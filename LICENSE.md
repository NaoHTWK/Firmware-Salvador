## Additional Terms for RoboCup Teams

The Software has been made publicly available to enable other RoboCup teams to study, reuse, and adapt its overall structure and individual components.

If a RoboCup team (the "Using Team") uses the Software, or any substantial part of it, in a RoboCup competition or official RoboCup event, the following additional conditions apply:

### Notification duty
**1.1** The Using Team must notify both (a) the mailing list of their respective RoboCup league and (b) naohtwk@gmail.com that it is using the Software, or parts of it, in the upcoming event.

**1.2** This notification must be sent no later than three (3) months before the start date of the respective competition or event.

**1.3** The notification must include a description of which components, modules, or algorithms from the Software are being used (e.g., localization, vision processing, team strategy, etc.).

**1.4** For the purposes of this license, "substantial part" includes individual modules, algorithms, or components, not only the complete Software framework.

### Late notification
**2.1** If the Using Team fails to provide notification in accordance with Section 1.2, the Using Team agrees to bring one German standard crate of beer (or an equivalent of 10 liters of beer) to the next RoboCup event in which both the Using Team and the HTWK Robots team participate.

**2.2** If the event takes place in a country where alcohol is not freely available for purchase or where legal restrictions apply, the Using Team may fulfill this obligation at a subsequent RoboCup event in a country where such restrictions do not apply.

### Relationship to the BSD License
These additional terms apply only to the use of the Software in the context of RoboCup competitions and official RoboCup events. For all other uses, the standard BSD 2-Clause License applies without modification.
